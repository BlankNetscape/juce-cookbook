## Intro

### Why did I write this

I started using JUCE because I wanted to make my own audio plugins and after doing a little bit research JUCE seemed to be the way to go.

Over the last couple of years, I have collected all of the resources related to JUCE that I could find. The list of bookmarked pages & code snippets have grown to quite a collection, so I decided to publish them as a cheat sheet for myself and everybody else who uses or wants to use JUCE.

### About myself

I started with programming at the age of 10. C++ was my first and primary language for the first couple of years. I have since then used Python, JS & Golang. I currently studying computer science with a focus on embedded systems in Berlin.

## Disclaimer

I'm definitely not an expert in JUCE or C++. I do have a job as a C++ developer, but unfortunately not using JUCE. So if you find any problems in my examples, feel free to open an issue.

## Code license

JUCE is published under a dual license, it is free for open source & small projects. You can find their license for JUCE 5 [here](https://juce.com/juce-5-license).

All of my example code in this repository is published to the public domain under the [Creative Commons CC0 1.0](#license) license.

## Contribute

If you find any bugs or design problems in my examples feel free to open up an issue on GitHub.

If you want to add examples or resources to this collection you can either push a pull request directly or open up an issue first, if you have any questions. Please make sure that your topic is not already covered by one of the official JUCE tutorials. If you want to add to one of the official tutorials make sure you include a link to that page, so we can keep duplicate code as minimal as possible. Maintaining the same tutorial twice doesn't make much sense.
