# Online resources

## Tutorials

- [JUCE tutorials](https://juce.com/learn/tutorials)

## Docs & Forum

The two most important resources when developing with JUCE are the official [JUCE documentation](https://juce.com/learn/documentation) & the [JUCE forum](https://forum.juce.com/).

The [API documentation](https://juce.com/learn/documentation) for JUCE is very good in my opinion. All of the classes & functions are clearly documented.

The same goes for the [forum](https://forum.juce.com/), every time I asked a question, it was answered on the same day, which compared to other communities is simply awesome.

## YouTube

If you like to learn using videos, you should be able to go from beginner to advanced using the resources found mainly on YouTube.

### ADC Talks

The JUCE team has their own [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCaF6fKdDrSmPDmiZcl9KLnQ/videos), where yo can find all of the talks from the yearly `Audio Developer Confrence (ADC)`. The content goes from general audio development to JUCE basics to advanced, companies showing of their workflow using JUCE and much more. I will link to specific talks in later sections.

### The Audio Programmer

`The Audio Programmer` is a YouTube channel which almost only does JUCE related development tutorials. He has videos for the basics on getting up & running with the library, introduction to `Components`, an introduction to audio plugin development and interviews with people working in the audio developer industry. Each video is `~20-60min` long.

If you are new to C++ and audio this is a create place to start.

If you are already pretty good in the language and have a basic understanding of audio in the digital world these videos will probably be a little to slow for you.

#### Discord

`The Audio Programmer` also runs a Discord channel for everything related to audio development. I hang around sometimes as well.
